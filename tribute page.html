   <ul ><b><big> Bhagat Singh's Revolutionary Activities/Contributions to Freedom Struggle:</big></ul></b>
<p><big>Although there have been many leaders from the revolutionary mould, Bhagat Singh's name is always first quoted when talking about revolutionary freedom fighters of India.

In 1926, he founded the Naujawan Bharat Sabha.
This organisation aimed to encourage revolution against British rule by rallying the peasants and workers.
Singh served as the organisation's secretary.
In 1928, he established the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) along with Sukhdev, Chandrashekhar Azad and others.
Lala Lajpat Rai died in 1928 as a result of injuries sustained in a police lathi charge on the orders of a Superintendent of Police, James Scott.
Bhagat Singh and his revolutionary friends decided to avenge the death of the dear leader.
However, in a case of mistaken identity, they assassinated another police official J P Saunders.
This was part of the Lahore Conspiracy Case.
After this incident, Singh fled from Lahore and made changes to his appearance.
Central Assembly Bombing Case
Bhagat Singh was also involved in this case.
On 8th April 1929, Singh and Batukeshwar Dutt threw a bomb in the Central Assembly at Delhi, from the Visitors Gallery.
They also threw pamphlets and raised pro-revolutionary slogans.
Both the revolutionaries courted arrest since they wanted to spread their message of revolution and anti-imperialism, and needed a platform for it.
Nobody was hurt in the incident, and it was never their intention to cause physical harm to anyone.
Their stated aim was to make the deaf hear.
Bhagat Singh was the mastermind behind the incident, and he was inspired by Auguste Vaillant, a French anarchist, who was executed by France for a similar incident in Paris.
In the trial that ensued, both Singh and Dutt were sentenced to transportation for life.
For more on the Central Assembly Bombing Case, check This Day in History dated 8th April.
In the meanwhile, the murder case of J P Saunders also came up and Singh was linked to that case as well.</big></p>
